Question - Create a Address Validation Schema/Code for an E-commerce Website.
    As the Complexity of Validating different elements of the Address
    have different complexity develop a system that Fails Fast using CASCADE Pattern.
    Also different Teams of the Website could require different parts of Address validated.
Code should -
    Tell point of Failure (What was entered wrong)
    Relation Validation (Can tell if the zip code and city matches)
    Single Responsibility Principle.
    Best Client User Experience.
    Least Dirty Code.
    Easy Testing.
    Abstraction (If we add a feature in our code the code for client should not change)

Ex- Teams:
        Order Dispatch          {zip,city}
        Cart                    {zip}
        Product Availability    {zip}

    Also, Complexity:
    House_No > City >= State >= Country >= zip
